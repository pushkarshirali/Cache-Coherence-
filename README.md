Cache-Coherence-Simulator
===============

The idea is implementing different protocols to make shared memory among different cores in a chip multiprocessor possible. 
Protocols implemented include: 
1. MSI
2. MESI 
3. MOSI 
4. MOESI 
5. MOESIF(also called MOESIsm)

All the header files/hash tables/driver files have not been uploaded because they do not belong to me. 
I will upload them once i acquire permission to do the same.
